# CBA-Mobile-Banking-Application-Prototype

The CBA Mobile Banking Application project is being undertaken by the SEG4105 project group for the Canadian Bank of Agriculture. The group will be submitting a bid to CBA to develop a mobile app for their online banking to compete with similar apps by competitors such as RBC and CIBC.

The objective of the project is to develop an app that will be compatible with both smartphones and tablets from Apple, BlackBerry, and Android devices. The group will manage all aspects of software development, both frontend and backend software interfacing with the existing online banking system from CBA. No changes will be made to CBAâ€™s existing system. To meet this requirement, the application will be compatible with Apache Tomcat, which the existing system was built in.
